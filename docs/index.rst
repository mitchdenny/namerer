Namerer
=======

Namerer is a cross-platform name text generator specifically designed to
ease the process of coming up with unique company, product, brand or project
names. Beyond just random strings, Namerer supports a template approach which
allows you to zero in on the name that you want to use.

You can use Namerer directly on the command-line, or within your own Node.js
projects.
